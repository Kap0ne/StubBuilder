This software should not be used within any system or network for which you do not have permission, nor should it be used for any illegal or illicit purposes. The author takes no responsibility for any damages that may be caused by the software in this repository.

Once compiled, Crypter WILL encrypt the files on the computer on which it is executed. Whilst Crypter provides you with access to the decryption key, enabling you to decrypt any encrypted files, bugs and other issues could, in theory, interrupt or prevent a successful decryption. Consequently, a permanent and irreversible loss of data could occur. To avoid any potential damage, ```you should only run Crypter on a test machine created for this purpose.```

## <h2 align="center">General Info</h2>
#### Features;
- Custom Values (Crypto name, Adress, Ransome Note, ...)
- Start as Admin
- Start Delay (Some Anti viruses will scan the file in a VM for only x sec. so if you make your file only start after 30 you can trick some.)
- Show fake Error on start

#### Info;
Files will be encryped and encryption key will be stored on the Desktop since this is for research only! I´ll not add a func. to send the key to a server, E-Mail etc. but if you want to add it you can make it and create a Pull request I´ll prob. add it.
**⚠️MALWARE AND BUILDER IS WINDOWS ONLY⚠️**
